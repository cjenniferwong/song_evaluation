## How can I leverage data to better predict whether a song is going to be a hit, and why?

Problem Statement: How can we focus resources into projects that are more likely to succeed? How do we measure whether or not a project is going to succeed and how sure are we about our predictions?

Deliverable: Model and Blog post explaining the process, outcomes, learnings, and next steps.

Dataset:
1. Scraped Billboards Top 100 Charts from January 2010 to July 2018.

### To Do:
- EDA
- clean and prepare data to use the Spotify API to search for songs to extract metadata
- machine learning and data science
- clean up repo and collect learnings and insight for blog post
