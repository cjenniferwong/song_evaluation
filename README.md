## How can I leverage data to better predict whether a song is going to be a hit, and why?

Problem Statement: How can we focus resources into projects that are more likely to succeed? How do we measure whether or not a project is going to succeed and how sure are we about our predictions?

Deliverable: Model and Blog post explaining the process, outcomes, learnings, and next steps.

Dataset:
1. Scraped Billboards Top 100 Charts from January 2010 to July 2018.

### To Do:
- EDA
- clean and prepare data to use the Spotify API to search for songs to extract metadata
    - creating an app and registering to get the credentials needed to use API
    - read the docs to learn how to use it
    - 
- machine learning and data science ?????? 
- clean up repo and collect learnings and insight for blog post
- [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lzOJkQ34iDTxcJq2Y0uoYU7W3QMMVC7yc9lahF59SPw/edit?usp=sharing]spotify_api_notes
